Command to Fabric and generate a peer admin card:
    cd ~/fabric-tools
    ./startFabric.sh
    ./createPeerAdminCard.sh


Command to create network archive:
    cd ~/we-trade
    composer archive create -a dist/we-trade.bna --sourceType dir --sourceName .

Command to install/start newwork:
  composer network install -a ./dist/we-trade.bna -c PeerAdmin@hlfv1
  composer network start -c PeerAdmin@hlfv1 -A admin -S adminpw -n we-trade -V 0.2.19
(Note: this step will create a business network card which named admin@we-trade.card. This 
is a zip file which contains connection.json and metadata.json. Copy these two files to
~/home/dayu/.composer/cards/admin@we-trade before start composer rest server.)

Command to start composer rest server:
  composer-rest-server -c admin@we-trade

Note:
If you are using our simple development server from composer-tools then you can add the following to the peer definition to see if it addresses the problem(v 0.19 #3731)

- CORE_CHAINCODE_STARTUPTIMEOUT=1200s

in the file ~/fabric-tools/fabric-scripts/hlfv11/composer/docker-compose.yml
eg, a snippet from the peer definition.

peer0.org1.example.com:
    container_name: peer0.org1.example.com
    image: hyperledger/fabric-peer:$ARCH-1.1.0
    environment:
      - CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL=debug
peer0.org1.example.com:
    container_name: peer0.org1.example.com
    image: hyperledger/fabric-peer:$ARCH-1.1.0
    environment:
      - CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL=debug
      - CORE_CHAINCODE_STARTUPTIMEOUT=1200s
      - CORE_CHAINCODE_LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG
You will need to restart your peer (but easiest would be to restart the whole fabric network)
